# Music App
A simple go at a Music Player using the Spotify API, Django DRF and VueJs.

It is not as pretty or functional as any other music player out there but its a start.

## Frameworks Used:

* Django REST Framework
* VueJS
* Vuetify

Using DRF as a backend API and having a seperate frontend using VueJS was challenging and fun. The frontend communicates with the backend using API calls which is being done through Axios in this case.
The styling was done using Vuetify, creating components and using a global state using Vuex. The codebase is not perfect but will keep improving on it.
